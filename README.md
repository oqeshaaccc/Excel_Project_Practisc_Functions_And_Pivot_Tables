# Excel_Project_Practisc_Functions_And_Pivot_Tables
This is a small Excel Project to practice Functions and Pivot tables
Clean Data was provided by the Coursera Excel Basics for Data Analysis course, I used Excel to
-  Format the data as a table
- Used AutoSum to calculate values for column ‘C’ and recorded each of the values:
          SUM,
          AVERAGE,
          MIN,
          MAX,
          COUNT
- Created a Pivot Tables that displays the sum of equipment count by department.

- Sorted the pivot table data using the Sort By Value setting on the pivot table to sort it in descending order by the sum of equipment count.

- Analyzed data in the pivot table to show the different vehicle types under each department with their respective counts.
